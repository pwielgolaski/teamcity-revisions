revisions plugin

Plugin provides extra properties to be used in build configuration i.e. for build number generation.

It provides properties:

* revisions.<id>.revision - Value of revision, for Git it is SHA hash
* revisions.<id>.short - Short hash for Git, otherwise N/A

Where <id> is id of your VCS defined in TeamCity.

Additionally for simplification there are properties

* revisions.revision
* revisions.short

Both refers to the first revision, if you have only one VCS root, it should be sufficient to use for you.
